This data download contains two data files. A “filtered” file that includes
the data for the countries, breakdowns, and periods that you selected and
an “all” file that contains all of the data covered by the OECD Going
Digital Toolkit for this indicator.

Several different time variables are used across the Toolkit databases:
“Year” is used to denote a specific year to which the value relates.
“Time” indicates the point in time to which the value relates.
Most often this is a specific year, but if the value relates to a multi-year
period (as indicated by “Period”), then “Time” takes the last year in the
period.“Period” also indicates the time to which a value relates. This may
be a multi-year period (e.g. 2014-2017), but in most cases it relates to a
specific year (and so equals “Year” or “Time”). Not all data download files
contain every one of these time variables.
